# Bus-Reservation-System

      This was my third year mini project, we were taught the basics of how to use netbeans IDE and told to develop an application in Java with MySql as database. Our guide Prof. Aruna Gupta really pushed us hard to learn and develop the application by ourself, checking for validations and errors. I have applied validations to all textfields including email and mobile number.
      It was fun coding and specially designing User Interface. designing and implementing Database was very easy as I used PhpMyAdmin to speed up my database work.
      Pull requests if you see any errors or of there are any suggestions for me.
